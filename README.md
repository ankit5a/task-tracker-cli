# Command Line To-Do List Manager üìù

This is a simple, file-based **Command-Line Interface (CLI) To-Do List Manager** built with Node.js. It allows users to manage their tasks directly from the terminal, storing all data persistently in a local `tasks.json` file.

## Features ‚ú®

  * **Add** new tasks with a description.
  * **List** all tasks or filter them by status (`todo`, `done`, `in-progress`).
  * **Update** the description of an existing task.
  * **Mark** a task as `done` or `in-progress`.
  * **Delete** tasks by their ID.
  * **Persistence**: Tasks are automatically saved to `tasks.json` between sessions.

## Data Storage

The application automatically creates a **`tasks.json`** file in the same directory to save your data. For Git best practices, this file should be included in your **`.gitignore`** to avoid committing local data.

**Example `tasks.json` structure:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "Buy milk, eggs, and bread",
    "status": "done",
    "createdAt": "2023-10-24T18:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2023-10-24T19:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```
